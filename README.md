# Practicing React Hooks with the Tailwind UI Take-Home Test

I recently read about the [hiring process](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/from-900-to-1-how-we-hired-robin-malfait) for [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

Part of the process included a [Take Home Test](https://github.com/adamwathan/tailwind-take-home-project).

I decided to give it a go in order to practice some of what I've learned using React Hooks.
